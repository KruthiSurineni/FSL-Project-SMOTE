Steps to run the code:

1. Unzip the Data folder.

2. Install/Check the dependencies by running the requirements.txt file in the src folder using following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. run the main.py file:
python main.py

4. Once the execution begins, the program provides with 3 choices:
	1. PIMA dataset
	2. Phoneme dataset
	3. Satimage dataset

5. Enter the choice to run the tests for the particular dataset.

6. The resultant ROC Curves graph is displayed. You can continue next by entering choice for another dataset.

7. Additionally, the resultant graphs are also store in the src/Graphics folder.

Time required to obtain graphs for each dataset:
1. PIMA dataset: 8-10 mins approx.
2. Phoneme dataset: 10-15 mins approx.
3. Satimage dataset: 30-40 mins approx.(Note: This dataset contains 36 features and total of 6435 samples. Hence, takes a considerable amount of time)

Note: Although, the synthetic datasets are attached in the zip file. The synthetic datasets generated are also available at:
